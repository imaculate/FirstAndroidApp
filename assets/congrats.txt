Congrats buddy!
Your are working out, eating less, loosing weight, you are on top of it , right?
Great job!
 Am curious..How have you done it?
 


If you exhibit any of these symptoms , you have the diet/fat mentality, we need to take care of that.

Do you avoid being around food? Or judge people who eat 'bad food'
even though they have managed to keep a stable weight? Does your life 
revolves around food  now? Do you workout to eat more? Are your conversations constantly
about food? 

If not, then my sincere congrats because you are smart and your body trusts otherwise please read on.

I was in the same shoes not so long ago
and just like 84% of dieters it didn't turn out so good. 
What works is not lifestyle changes but common sense. It is after all your body, so, your rules!
