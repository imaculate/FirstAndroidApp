Thin people workout and they eat right, but they don't have the diet mentality.

They workout because they are used to it,most likely in their spare time.

They don't think about food all the time. You probably do. They don't count calories to avoid working
out , or work out to eat more. They just do everything naturally and it is working for them. You should try it too!
