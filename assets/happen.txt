What just happened?

You started dieting, it was hard at first but you used your will power, all the 
resources you had to stick with it. You started loosing weight, your 
appetite decreases, everyone is complimenting you, you are now a rolemodel.

You didn't trick your body, your body is just adapting, and adaptation
only lasts for a short while. Soon you are gonna want to live normal again and talk 
about something else for a change. Something you wont be able to keep because (it was not a
lifestyle change') but a diet.

You are no longer listening to your body because you don't trust it, so your 
body doesn't trust you anymore. As soon as you 'allow' yourself a treat, it almost 
always results into a binge because the reward centres of your brain have been altered 
to only value food. 

For the sake of your future self, please respect that body and read on.
