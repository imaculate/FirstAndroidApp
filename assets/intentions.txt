You have the right intentions buddy, so you want to go on another calorie restricting diet?
That diet mentality disguised as lifestyle changes wont make you thin. Instead it will give you these side effects.

1)Cravings.
What do you do when you are 'saving yourself' for a delicious dinner. You eat less,  probably workout because you want to enjoy your meal later on. 
The same thing you are advised to do to loose weight. So you are kind of tricking your body to expect a better/big meal later on. 
Only that When you are trying to loose weight, you don't get the big meal. That's how you start craving chocolates, and all those weird 
things you never used to crave for before. Before you know it, Your relationship to food will be completely unnatural and abnormal...Trust me , been there, done that.
It was like my reward systems were completely altered, nothing else mattered but food. 



2)Bingeing, Food addiction. 
with a diet you will loose weight, that is until you hit your breaking point. One day your body will just break out of survival.
in the form of  an addiction/bingeing. Food will be the source of comfort. No, you do not want that disorder. 



3) Loosing weight isn't the problem. You'll never be perfect, that's a fact. 
There are benefits to loosing weight, you will be more active, more energy, people will compliment you a lot. But 
sorry to disappoint you buddy, you wont be perfect. You will most likely not look like those supermodels on magazines,
you will notice other aspects of your life that need attention, that's disappointing considering you think you have it all
figure out. 


4) You will confuse people, they will compliment when you loose weight, but when you gain it back(and there is a pretty good 
chance you will) , you will have to suffer through the awkward silences and disappointments. Trust me when I tell it isn't great.
