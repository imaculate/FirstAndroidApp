With the 'lifestyle change' you are on now, 
if you stick with it you are setting yourself up for some 
serious damage.

1) When you hit your goal weight, there will be nothing left there. 
You will be sorrounded with the fear of gaining weight, or eventually gain back it.

2) You know those cravings and hunger you always suppress ? They'll multiply, every time you see 
food, it will be a temptation. Too bad your will power won't be enough this time.

3) You will realise that you are not perfect. Other aspects of your life need attention too
and I guess that even more disappointing. 

4) Emotional eating. It mostly happens to dieters, not normal people,
they eat to comfort themselves because that's what the body has been missing and needs 
the most. 

We dont want that, do we?
