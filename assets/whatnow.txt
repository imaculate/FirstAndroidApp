Listen to your body, like I said before. It wont start overnight but you will get there
You are probably afraid now because you don't trust your body anymore but you it takes time.
Meg Meranus describes that there are many stages towards a healthy relationship to food but 
you are guaranteed to succeed. 

Your body will probably get you eat more because it has been on survival mode for the longest 
time. Worry out, eat , soon enough, no food will have power on you. Afterall its just food.
Remember what I said about setpoint? Trust your body, it knows what to do. When you crave nuts ,
eats nuts until you are full then move on, trust me you'll find yourself craving brocolli sometime.





Soon enough , you'll realise that your clothes are loose and everyone thinks 
you are on a 'lifestyle change' again. Go preach, they need to hear the truth. 


Long story short, loosen up, play by your rules.
