Yes, you are because Dr.Oz said so.
No you are not.

You will get healthier not by drinking green tea and eating carrots but by 
listening to your body. 

Research has shown (you can google this) that all you need people who are loosing weight,
have good health indicators (such as low cholesterol, endomorphins, moderate heart rate)
not because of a smaller weight they are carrying but because they are exercising and eating right.
That's all you need, a few walks in the parks, some squats if you want to etc. So trust your body, 
you wont eat Mcdonald's everyday.
