Yes, carrying excess weight more than your setpoint is unhealthy. Dieting isn't 
the solution either. 

Good old fashioned logic is the true answer. 

Those 'friends' who call you have  probably never experienced your life, so 
why should their opinion matter.

They have probably failed at dieting that they find it funny to ridicule others.

Simple advice: keep the weight conversation out of the table(because there is lots of things 
to talk about in life), educate them if possible,
if problems persists, ignore it, they clearly you can't change anyone. 

Your body, your rules!
