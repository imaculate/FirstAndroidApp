They are in a dieter's high. Yes, those people who are showing off their abs. 
I was one of them, I had it all figured out, reduce food intake , workout and everyone 
will give you attention. Its called a dieter's high and it doesnt last.

They are kind of people who will frown and cringe at the thought of a dinner party because
they'll have to consider all the nutritional information of the menu.

They workout and count calories because they believe it is the only way to live. (which 
is completely unnatural)

They are obsessed with food. (That's probably all they talk about which in my opinion is
pretty shallow)

Your Health, your rules, your body is unique, trust it and it will trust you, it will lead 
you to what you really need.
