What if I told you don't have to fight so hard to live?
You don't earn your body, no your body takes care of itself. 

You don't have to dread food, or workout like an athlete to get lean.

You simply have to listen to your body. Yes, trust your body because it knows a lot more than
the doctor or your personal trainer. When you are hungry, it is out of energy so eat, when you are
sore, muscles need to repair so don't workout, when you are stiff, you need to move, so walk, run, dance,
squat, stretch, jump whatever it is that will get you sweating. Its the most natural thing to do.

Got my point? Its a good thing that you are loosing weight but you need to get rid of the fat mentality.
They call it a lifestyle change but its just diet in disguise. Trust me, I've been there and done that,
until all my life started revolving around my weight..no it should be the other way around. 

Don't believe me?
