Congratulations! You made it. The scale now reads exactly what you want it to, you are the star, you are getting 
compliments from everyone around you. I personally applaud. I just have a few questions:

1)When you see your before pictures, do you feel like the fat will soon come back if you stop this lifestyle?

2) Do you think about food all the time? or avoid places with food?

3) Do you label yourself health conscious because there is no alternative? 

Congratulations dear but its high time you got a life, yes there is a life where
you don't revolve about your weight. Please read on to get what those rules are.
