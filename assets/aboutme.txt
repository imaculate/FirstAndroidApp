 This app is written based on facts and my experience. I'm not saying that if you loose weight you'll 
 answer all your problems. I'm not saying that if you loose weight you'll gain it all back. I'm just warning 
 you of what could happen to you. I lost about 30 Kg in 5 months. Life was amazing when I was loosing it, until I 
 became underweight, and then I became a food addict, and then  regained all the weight back.It has taken a lot of time 
 and energy to have a healthy relationship to food, but am glad I did. I see lots of people going through diets(disguised as
 lifestyle changes), and not getting the results they want because the truth is we have been fooled not to trust our bodies.
 Calorie counting is not a natural way to live, never has it been.
 I lost a lot because of the gaining weight , my life was falling apart. I don't want you to go through that please do read the articles.
 share them , send me feedback. I really appreciate it.
