 This app is written based on facts and my experience. I'm not saying that if you loose weight you'll 
 answer all your problems. I'm not saying that if you loose weight you'll gain it all back. I'm just warning 
 you of what could happen to you. I lost about 30 Kg in 5 months. Life was amazing when I was loosing it, until I 
 became underweight, and then I became a food addict, and then  regained all the weight back.
