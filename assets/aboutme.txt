 As you will notice, this app is written based on facts and my experience.
 So who am I? I'm just a girl who was once obsessed with calorie counting loose weight.  
 I kept track of every calorie I ate and every  calorie I burnt as a result I lost more than 30 Kg in 5 months. 
 I felt amazing or rather high that I had it all figured out. Loosing weight and maintaining it is just a matter of 
 math right? I was wrong. Those 5 months were not my healthiest , my body was simply surviving and ldesperately looking for 
 calories. Willpower just didn't cut it when all I could think of was food, food, food. Nothing made sense apart from food. 
 You know how a junkie reacts to drugs? That was how I reacted to food, only that food is everywhere and you 
 can't live without it. You have probably been there or you do not want to be there.
  Then I realised this was the second time I lost weight and this abnormal appetite was taking over me. I thought I was 
  alone, all the stories on the internet are about losing weight and the sucess stories, which makes me a loser. How depressing.
  Have you ever made lifestyle changes only to find them backfiring on you, then you keep going back to the same old 
  'lifestyle' changes that don't work? I think I have some answers. I made this app so that you don't have to go through 
  what I went through.
 Through this thoughtful women, I was able to recover and eat 'normally' again, I hope you find their resources helpful.
