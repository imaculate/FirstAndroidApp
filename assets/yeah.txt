So you are probably wondering if that's what really happens. Yes it does,
For God's sake I even forgot that am in Africa , and millions die of hunger here. 
if diets(disguised as lifestyle changes) worked, celebrities wouldn't be struggling with their weights.
Why do we constantly see before and after photos in the news? 
The diet industry is a profit business and it is present for the sole purpose of making 
profits, no more , no less. They'll sell shakes, magic pills, chocolate flavored green tea ( or whatever funny gimmicks they come up with)
They want you to loose weight , gain weight so that you are running back at them for more, that's how they make money.
Think Oprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga, and all other celebrities you have heard of, even the people in your community, 
Do they maintain the weight in a natural way like thin people do?
Here is what happens
1) Give up and suffer with low self esteem and unhealthy living for the rest of your life.
2) Become a full time health expert so that your only job is keep your figure.(Am pretty sure
you have a life already)

3) Go on cycles of weight gain/ weight loss ( a common scenario today that it has become 'normal')-yo-yo dieting.

4) Stop with this diet mentality and start listening to your body.
