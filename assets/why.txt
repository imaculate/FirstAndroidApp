Really? Why?
You are trusting your body, you are healthy, you are not constantly hungry... that's the definition of life.

1) You will have the confidence that comes not from drinking green tea but from embracing your body as is, because the two of you are in 
sync.

2) It is sheer common sense. Something we the out the window when the word calorie step in. 

Your Health, your rules!
